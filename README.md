# Elastix-for-Raspberry
This is actually a manipulated uelastix (popular VoIP package based on asterisk) which works with Raspberry Pi 1, 2, and 3
As it is an OS image, there will be no code. Instead, go to the releases and download them. They are parted files, resulting to an img file which is in fact an SD image for Pi boards.
Passwords, requirements, notes and any required info are written under release descriptions.
